# claude-desktop-integration

Run **Claude Desktop** (Cowork / Chat / Code sessions) on Opus 5.5, through the same
LiteLLM proxy idea as `zim-claude` — but wired up the way Claude Desktop actually
supports third-party models.

```
Claude Desktop (Cowork / Chat / Code)
     |  POST /v1/messages   Authorization: Bearer sk-claude-desktop-local
     v
LiteLLM :4002   (litellm-config.desktop.yaml)
     |  OpenAI-style
     v
Token Juice  ->  Opus 5.5
```

This is **separate from the CLI proxy** on `:4000`, so `zim-claude` keeps working
untouched. Own port, own config, own PID file.

## Why an env file is not enough

`~/claude-source/deepseek-claude` (the `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
profile) only steers the **Claude Code CLI**. Claude Desktop is a different app: when it
spawns its embedded agent it *blanks* those variables and injects its own credentials, so
exporting them has no effect. Claude Desktop only accepts a custom endpoint through its
**Third-Party Inference → Gateway** setting (or the equivalent managed config).

Claude Desktop also imposes two rules the proxy has to obey:

1. **Model names must look Anthropic-shaped.** Any model whose name lacks `claude` /
   `anthropic` is dropped from the picker:
   *`inferenceModels: "X" is not an Anthropic model and was removed from the list`*.
   So Opus 5.5 is exposed as `claude-opus-5-5` (an Opus-tier name).
2. **Anthropic-only fields must be tolerated.** Cowork/Code send `cache_control`,
   `tool_reference`, beta headers. The upstream is OpenAI-style, so the config sets
   `drop_params: true` to avoid HTTP 400s.

Requirements met by this setup: LiteLLM ≥ v1.98.0 (for `GET /v1/models` discovery) and a
gateway that implements `POST /v1/messages` — both true of LiteLLM here.

## Install

```bash
cd claude-desktop-integration
./install.sh
```

That makes the scripts executable, starts the proxy on `:4002`, and prints the exact
values to paste into Claude Desktop. It does **not** touch `:4000` or your shell config.

Then, in Claude Desktop:

1. **Help → Troubleshooting → Enable Developer Mode**
2. **Claude menu → Developer → Configure Third-Party Inference…**
3. Connection section:

   | Field | Value |
   |---|---|
   | Inference provider | `Gateway` |
   | Gateway base URL | `http://127.0.0.1:4002` |
   | Gateway API key | `sk-claude-desktop-local` |
   | Gateway auth scheme | `bearer` |

4. **Apply Changes** (older builds: *Apply locally*), then **restart Claude Desktop**.

The picker now lists `claude-opus-5-5`, and every Cowork,
Chat and Code model call goes to LiteLLM → Token Juice → Opus 5.5.

### No-click alternative (managed config)

If you'd rather not click through the UI, install the managed settings file:

```bash
./install.sh --managed          # needs sudo -> /etc/claude-desktop/managed-settings.json
./install.sh --uninstall-managed
```

This is the same content as `managed-settings.json`. A managed profile may make the app
show a *managed configuration* notice — that is expected.

## Manage the proxy

```bash
./start-desktop-proxy.sh start     # bring it up
./start-desktop-proxy.sh status
./start-desktop-proxy.sh gateway   # print the 3 values for the UI
./start-desktop-proxy.sh logs      # tail /tmp/litellm-desktop.log
./start-desktop-proxy.sh restart
./start-desktop-proxy.sh stop
```

## Verify

```bash
./verify.sh
```

Checks the health endpoint, `GET /v1/models` (that a `claude*` model is discoverable),
and a real `POST /v1/messages` round-trip.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_PORT` | `4002` | proxy port |
| `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_LITELLM_KEY` | `sk-claude-desktop-local` | gateway key (bearer) |
| `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG` | `./litellm-config.desktop.yaml` | proxy config |
| `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_LOG` | `/tmp/litellm-desktop.log` | log file |
| `LITELLM_ENV_FILE` | `~/claude-source/deepseek-claude` | profile with the upstream token |

Use a different upstream profile:

```bash
LITELLM_ENV_FILE=~/claude-source/some-other-model ./start-desktop-proxy.sh restart
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `litellm-config.desktop.yaml` | LiteLLM config: claude-named aliases, `drop_params`, master key |
| `start-desktop-proxy.sh` | start/stop/status/logs for the `:4002` proxy |
| `managed-settings.json` | Third-Party Inference config (flat gateway form) |
| `install.sh` | glue: checks, permissions, optional managed settings, start, instructions |
| `verify.sh` | endpoint + model-name checks |

## Caveats

- **Enabling third-party inference signs the app out of your Claude.ai subscription
  path.** Model calls go to your gateway instead. Switch the provider back to default to
  revert.
- **Desktop sends the gateway key, not an Anthropic OAuth token.** That's fine here: the
  upstream credential lives in `litellm-config.desktop.yaml` (via `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
  from the profile), so LiteLLM reaches Token Juice on its own.
- **Anthropic-only capabilities won't apply** — 1M context, prompt-cache reuse and some
  beta headers depend on an Anthropic upstream; Opus 5.5 won't honor them.
- Same token as `zim-claude`; rotate at Token Juice if it leaks, then restart both
  proxies.

## Troubleshooting

- **Picker is empty / model missing.** Confirm `./verify.sh` shows a `claude*` id from
  `/v1/models`. A non-claude name is silently dropped by the app.
- **Requests fail with 400.** The upstream rejected Anthropic-only fields — ensure
  `drop_params: true` is on the model entry (it is by default here).
- **App can't reach the proxy.** Use `127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`) in the base URL, and
  check `./start-desktop-proxy.sh status`.
- **Nothing changed after editing config.** `./start-desktop-proxy.sh restart`, then
  restart Claude Desktop.
- **`{"error":{"message":"No connected db.","type":"no_db_connection"}}`.** The gateway
  key did not match `master_key`. Make sure the app's *Gateway API key* is exactly
  `sk-claude-desktop-local` (or whatever `CLAUDE_DESKTOP_LITELLM_KEY` you set). With no
  matching key LiteLLM tries to treat it as a DB-backed virtual key and there is no DB,
  hence the odd message.
